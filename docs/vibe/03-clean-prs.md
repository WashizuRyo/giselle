# Clean Pull Requests for Vibe Coders

This guide provides best practices for vibe coders to create clean, focused pull requests when making design changes.

## Pull Request Best Practices

### 1. Focus on One Thing

Each PR should focus on a single purpose - whether it's a UI improvement, a bugfix, or a feature addition. This makes your changes easier to review and less likely to create unexpected problems.

Good PR examples:
- "Improve panel design with new resize handles and empty state buttons"
- "Update font weights and spacing in text components"

### 2. Avoid Unrelated Changes

Some common unrelated changes that should be avoided:

- **Package version updates**: Don't manually edit package.json or pnpm-lock.yaml unless your PR specifically needs dependency updates.
- **Port changes**: Don't change server ports in package.json scripts.
- **Environment modifications**: Don't modify .env files or .gitignore unless your feature specifically requires it.
- **Build configuration**: Don't modify webpack or other build configs without discussing first.

### 3. Follow the Design-First Workflow

When implementing design changes:

1. **Mock up your changes**: Use design tools to visualize your improvements first
2. **Identify the specific files to change**: Look for the relevant components that need updating
3. **Make minimal code changes**: Modify only what's needed to achieve your design goal
4. **Test your changes**: Verify your design works as expected
5. **Create a focused PR**: Submit only the changes directly related to your design improvements

### 4. How to Check Your Changes Before Creating a PR

Always review what you're about to commit:

```bash
# See what files you've changed
git status

# See your changes in detail
git diff

# If you see unrelated files in git status:
git checkout -- path/to/unrelated/file
```

### 5. Common Issues for Vibe Coders

#### Package Lock Files

Never manually edit `pnpm-lock.yaml`. This file is automatically generated.

#### Port Changes

If you need to change a port for your local development, use a local `.env` file instead of changing it in package.json.

Example `.env.local`:
```
PORT=3001
```

#### Adding New Dependencies

If you need a new package:
- Discuss with the team first
- Add it with `pnpm add package-name`
- Don't manually edit package.json

## Submission Guidance (Design Tokens Migration)

When submitting PRs related to the design token migration:

- Prefer base branch: `colors-foundation-v3` when applicable to minimize diffs.
- Keep PR size small: target ~200 lines (max 400).
- If adding aliases, keep them minimal in `internal-packages/ui/styles/aliases.css` and submit as a separate small PR.

## Getting Help

If you're unsure about any changes, ask for help from the engineering team before creating your PR. 

Remember: Clean, focused PRs that only contain relevant changes get reviewed and merged much faster!
