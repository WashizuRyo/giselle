### Submission Guidance (Design Tokens Migration)
- Prefer base branch: `colors-foundation-v3` when applicable to minimize diffs.
- Keep PR size small: target ~200 lines (max 400).
- If adding aliases, keep them minimal in `internal-packages/ui/styles/aliases.css` and submit as a separate small PR.
